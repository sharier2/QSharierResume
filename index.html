    <!--Summary************************************-->
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Quentin Sharier, and I am a highly motivated and skilled software engineer with a passion 
        for creating innovative solutions in the IT domain. I recently graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science 
        Engineering from Ohio State University, where I maintained a 3.62 Major GPA and consistently made it to 
        the Dean's List throughout my academic journey. My technical expertise spans various areas, including 
        algorithms, computer architecture, databases, artificial intelligence, web applications, and information 
        security. Proficient in various programming languages such as Java, C#, Python, and more. I can tackle 
        complex challenges and turn ideas into reality. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to my academic accomplishments, I bring 
        valuable hands-on experience, having worked as a Black Hawk Mechanic in the Ohio Army National Guard, 
        I developed a disciplined and focused approach to tasks, performing under intense pressure while ensuring 
        the safety and functionality of a fleet of helicopters. As a former Care Provider, I honed my communication 
        and problem-solving skills while assisting handicapped individuals. Moreover, my tenure with Amazon as an 
        Amnesty team member involved maintaining and resolving issues related to the Kiva robotic system, further 
        strengthening my technical prowess.
